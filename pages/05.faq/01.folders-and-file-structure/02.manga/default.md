### Manga Structure
A good structure would be:

* /libraryroot/Series Name/Series Name v01.cbz  
* /libraryroot/Series Name/Series Name v02.cbz  
* /libraryroot/Series Name/Series Name v03 c01.cbz  
 

### Manga Specials

Kavita treats multiple types of files as "Specials" and will group them in a separate tab in series detail. Special marker (SP) will be removed from the UI title, however used when ordering. 

An entity is considered a special when:

1. A series can be parsed out of it, but no volume or chapter information is found.
*  /libraryroot/Series Name/Series Name.cbz 

2. There are keywords in the filename like "Specials", "Omake" "OneShot", "Extra", "Art Collection", "Side Stories"
*  /libraryroot/Series Name/Specials/Series Name Omake.cbz 

3. To force a Special status, the filename can use SP01, SP02 etc.
*  /libraryroot/Series Name/Series Name SP01.cbz
*  /libraryroot/Series Name/Specials/Series Name SP01 Special Name.cbz
