title: 'External Readers'

Kavita will work with external readers over OPDS. Some readers support OPDS-PS (which in our implementation, we will track progress as you read) and OpenSearch (hooks into our search code rather than just on the feed). What you find below is not an exhaustive list, but rather what has been tested to work with Kavita.
