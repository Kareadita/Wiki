title: 'External Readers'
---

If using Kavita's built-in readers is not your cup of tea, you can use external readers over OPDS. OPDS is an open protocol to allow downloading and reading content. OPDS by default does not allow for any progress tracking unless you use OPDS-PS with Kavita. What you find below is not an exhaustive list, but rather what has been tested to work with Kavita. 


## Android
* Librera: OPDS/Download
* Moon Reader: OPDS, epub, archives
* Kubo Reader: Downloaded files only, epub not supported
* Tachiyomi: Reading supported, Progress syncing to be released soon


## iOS
* Chunky: Supports OPDS-PS, epub not supported
* Panels: Supports OPDS-PS, epub not supported
* Yomu: OPDS, Downloaded files, epub, archives
* Paperback (planned)
