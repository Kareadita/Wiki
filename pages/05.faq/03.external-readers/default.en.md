title: 'External Readers'
---

If using Kavita's builtin readers is not your cup of tea, you can use external readers over OPDS. OPDS is an open protocol to allow downloading and exploring reading content. OPDS by default does not allow for any progress tracking unless you use OPDS-PS with Kavita. What you find below is not an exhaustive list, but rather what has been tested to work with Kavita. 


## Android
* Librera


## iOS
* Chunky: Supports OPDS-PS, epub not supported
* Panels: epub not supported
* Yomu (epub only)

! We do not yet have a Tachiyomi plugin for a first class reading experience on Android. If you are interested in helping us build one, please join the discord and ping majora2007.
