Changelogs of all Kavita stable builds, which can also be found on [Github](https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/releases).

#### v0.2 - Kavita v0.2
Feb 15, 2021

This was a fairly large release. This release originally was aimed at stabilizing and testing against a real library. During this, a ton of bugs were found that led to a complete rewrite to the DB structure and Scanning code. This helped Kavita have not only a more flexible structure, but improved matching and large speed ups. 

This release delivers the following:
- Stability & Bug fixes
- Ability to configure server settings 
- Ability to scheduler re-occurring Tasks
- Ability to mark a whole volume/chapter as read/unread
- Ability to reset user logins
- Ability to search library for items a user has access to
- Ability to log to file with rolling backups
- Ability to have user preferences reflect throughout app
- Ability to split full spread manga pages
- A full responsive pass-through on the app

Currently only building for Windows, create an issue if you want other OS builds.

#### v0.1 - Kavita  v0.1
Jan 20, 2021

First release of Kavita. This release is more of a milestone than a proper release (although you can actually use server). This release allows for:
* User creation with Roles (admin/non-admin)
* Role based access to Libraries
* Segregation of Manga in different Libraries for whatever your needs
* Ability to rate manga
* Ability to track read progress
* Ability to read archive-based manga (cbz, cbr, zip)
* Ability to scan libraries ad-hoc
* Cache management
* Ability to read manga (no split page support)

While a lot was accomplished, a lot of the work is preliminary. This is the foundation for the next releases and polishing efforts.
