Changelogs of all Kavita stable builds, which can also be found on [Github](https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/releases).


-------------------------

##### v0.1 - Kavita  v0.1
Date

First release of Kavita. This release is more of a milestone than a proper release (although you can actually use server). This release allows for:
* User creation with Roles (admin/non-admin)
* Role based access to Libraries
* Segregation of Manga in different Libraries for whatever your needs
* Ability to rate manga
* Ability to track read progress
* Ability to read archive-based manga (cbz, cbr, zip)
* Ability to scan libraries ad-hoc
* Cache management
* Ability to read manga (no split page support)

While a lot was accomplished, a lot of the work is preliminary. This is the foundation for the next releases and polishing efforts.
