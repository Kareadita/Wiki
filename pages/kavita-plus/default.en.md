Kavita+ is a premium service offered by the Kavita Team which unlocks a set of features for your Kavita application. Kavita+ is a way to gain some monetary support to further dedicate time into the Kavita application, think of it as a way to support the development of Kavita while also getting some sweet features out of it. The goal is to not lock all features behind Kavita+, but add features that otherwise aren't feasible in the base product.

Kavita+ is a monthly subscription for your individual instance and is node-locked. Once active, all users on your server gain the benefit.
