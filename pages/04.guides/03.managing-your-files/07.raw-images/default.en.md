Raw Images (Manga/Comic) library types are supported as loose leaf images within a folder. It is advisable to put a second folder named Volume 1 (and chapters if needed) so that the files are grouped as one volume, otherwise they will all be separate specials.
```
└── Manga 2
    └── Vol1
        └── Ch1 - Ch3
            ├── Image 1.jpg
            ├── Image 2.jpg
            └── Image 3.jpg
```
