! Raw Image support is under discussion to be removed. Please voice your opinion [here](https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/issues/2154) if you believe Kavita should keep it.

Raw Images (Manga/Comic) library types are supported as loose leaf images within a folder. It is advisable to put a second folder named Volume 1 (and chapters if needed) so that the files are grouped as one volume, otherwise they will all be separate specials.
