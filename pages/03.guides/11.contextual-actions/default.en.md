In Kavita, there are many different actions you can take on different entities. This page covers the different actions you can take.


### Downloading
If a user has the Download role, they can download files from Kavita. Because Kavita uses a grouping mechanic, the downloads will mimic this structure. From any Series, Volume, or Chapter, a user can kick off a download via the context menu. If the underlying file is just one individual file, it will be sent as is, otherwise, the files will be grouped in a zip and downloaded. 

Downloads may take longer than expected to process. Kavita will show a spinner on the item you are attempting to download from.

### Bookmarks
Bookmarks are pages that you want to download after reading for a given series. While using the web reader, you can bookmark certain pages using the bookmark button on the top right. This will save a reference to that page for the given series. At any point in the future, you can use the Series detail context action to open the bookmarks modal for that series. This will give you the option to download all bookmarks in a zip file or delete all references to the bookmarks. You can also view all bookmarks for your account in your [User Settings](https://wiki.kavitareader.com/en/guides/preferences#bookmarks).
