Reading Lists are an ordered set of chapters that can be created and promoted (made visible to all users on the server). Like Collections, they can have a a cover image and summary. 

The main features of a reading list are the order. Reading order is enforced at the issue level and when reading a reading list, the readers are capable of moving between different types of readers. So the list could start with Manga then move into epub reader then to pdf and back to Manga without ever leaving the reader. 

The list order can be changed by using drag and drop or clicking Order Numbers and shifting order number directly.
