! This functionality requires v0.5.2.14+

Starting with v0.5.2.14, Kavita allows you to express relationships between different series. Unlike reading lists, linked series provide more context as to how different series relate to each other. 

Kavita doesn't dictate any rules to how the relationships are used, however, we do have some suggestions below. When configuring a linked series, for everything but a Prequel or Sequel, Kavita will show a relationship back to the parent series.


|Relationship | Description |  
|  ------ | ------ |
|sequel |         Direct continuation of the story. |
|prequel |        Story that occurred before the original. |
|alternative setting |        Same universe/world/reality/timeline, completely different characters. |
|alternative version |        Same setting, same characters, story is told differently. |
|side story |         Takes place sometime during the parent storyline. |
|parent |         This field is not selectable. Shows for everything but Sequel/Prequel/Edition |
|spin-off |       Uses characters of a different series, but is not an alternate setting or story.|
|adaptation |         Manga/Anime adaptation. |
|character  |     When characters appear in both series, but is not a spin-off|
|contains  |  Not sure, MAL used it.   |
|editon  |  When another series is a special edition or colored edition   |
| doujinshi | A fan published work of the series | 
|other  |     When nothing else fits |
