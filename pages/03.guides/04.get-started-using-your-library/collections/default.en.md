### Collections

To create a collection, select the Edit option in the Context Action Menu ![Kavita%20Context%20Action%20Menu](Kavita%20Context%20Action%20Menu.png "Kavita%20Context%20Action%20Menu"), a collections tag can be created and will be used to create a collection with that name. Other books, comics and manga can have this tag added to become part of the collection.

When selected, all series in the collection will be available.

! **Note**: Although a promoted collection can be seen by others, they may not have access to the items due to user access restrictions on what Libraries they can see.
