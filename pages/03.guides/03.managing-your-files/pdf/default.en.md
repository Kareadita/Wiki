### PDF (v0.4.3+)
PDF files are supported and will be parsed from solely the filename. If the PDF file is within a Manga library, the Manga parsing will be used. Likewise, if under a comic library, Comic parsing code will be used.

PDF files do not have any metadata extraction, so the filename or folder name will be critical to name extraction.
