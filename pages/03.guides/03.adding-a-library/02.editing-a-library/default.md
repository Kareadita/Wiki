### Adding another Folder to an existing Library

Many different directories from several sources can be added to Kavita in order to add content to a Library. As long as the Type of content is the same, other directories can be added to a Library.
The "Shared Folders:" line on the Libraries Dashboard shows have many folders have been added.

Each folder has a Share button which can be used to select all content in all sub-folders. However, Clicking on the folder names allows you to drill down further to Share the exact folder you want.
