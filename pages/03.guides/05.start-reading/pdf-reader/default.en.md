# PDF Reader
The PDF Reader (v0.5.4+) is unique in that we are using an out-of-the-box library instead of a homegrown solution. Because of this, the reader is currently limited in design and custom functionality.

### Search
Upon pressing the search in the top left, the user can search for text within the document. 

### Pagination
There are controls to jump through the document. Continuous reading is not implemented for PDF Reader.

### Light/Dark mode
This is very experimental and may be prone to rendering issues. By pressing the sun/moon in top right, you can toggle the light/dark mode. 

### Page Layout
There are many layouts supported out of box by this reader. Use the hamburger menu on the right to activate them. 

### Table of Contents
A Table of contents is provided in the left hamburger menu along with a page preview.
