### Collections

By selecting the Edit option in the Action Menu a Collections tag can be created and will be used to create a collection with that name. Other Books/Comics/Manga can have this Tag added to become part of the Collection which will be shown on the Kavita Homepage.

![Collections](Collections.jpg "Collections")
Collections will appear at the bottom of the Kavita homepage. (Collections do not support cover art at this time.)
![KavitaCollectionsHomepageNew](KavitaCollectionsHomepageNew.jpg "KavitaCollectionsHomepageNew")
When selected all items in the Collection will be available.
![KavitaCollectionSelected](KavitaCollectionSelected.jpg "KavitaCollectionSelected")
To "Promote" a Collection to other Kavita users' homepage, select the Action Button on the Collection and select Edit. And then the Promote button.

![KavitaCollectionPromotion2](KavitaCollectionPromotion2.jpg "KavitaCollectionPromotion2")
! **Note**: Although a Promoted Collection can be seen by others, they may not have access to the items due to user access restrictions on what Libraries they can see.
