OPDS is an open standard for browsing and consuming content on your server from external readers. To enable OPDS for your server, under System Settings, enable OPDS.

![Setting](Setting.PNG "Setting")

This will grant all your users a unique URL and an API key (like a unique password) to access your server from these external readers. The url can be found under user settings.

![user-setting](user-setting.PNG "user-setting")

From this UI, a user can use the copy button to quickly copy it into their clipboard. The red refresh button is used to generate a new API key and thus a new url.

Kavita supports OPDS-PS (page streaming) which will capture your progress when reading through external readers. Currently only Chunky Reader on iOS supports OPDS-PS.
