## Filtering
Filtering allows the user to select the type of content displayed in a Library
Select the Funnel at the top right to open the Filtering options
![kavita_Library_Filtering](kavita_Library_Filtering.jpg "kavita_Library_Filtering")

This will open the filtering section to allow you to explore your library. The filtering screen is dynamically created based on the screen. In the below example, the Libraries is already pre-selected as Comics, since the section was opened on the Comics library view. If on a collection page, then the collection page will be pre-selected. 

From this page, you can select a set of tags to search against. The search will always OR each field. All fields will be filtered against the library you are currently in. Files in other libraries will not be shown, even if they match the tags you are searching for. The rating field will show as the minimum rating. If you select 3 stars, then anything with 3 or more stars will be returned.
