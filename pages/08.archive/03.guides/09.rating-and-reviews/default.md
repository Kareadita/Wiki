Kavita allows you to track your rating and provide a review for yourself all within Kavita. Currently, Kavita has its own, separate system, however, Scrobbing and Syncing to external sources are planned.

To provide a rating, click the star icons. When you first provide a rating, a prompt will ask if you want to add a review. Adding a text-based review is optional. If you clicked no and want to add or edit your rating or review, you can click the edit icon displayed next to the star rating.
