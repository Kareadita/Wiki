Continue Reading

To start reading you can either click the individual volume or chapter or let Kavita resume you where you left off by clicking the ![continue](continue.png "continue") button. This will open the last chapter that you have progress on or the next (if the last one was finished).

If you haven't started reading something, ![continue](continue.png "continue") button will be replaced by the ![read](read.png "read") button
