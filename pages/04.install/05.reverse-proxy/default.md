### What is a Reverse Proxy?

A Reverse Proxy allows you to share web based services, like Kavita, outside of your home network through the upload bandwidth of your home internet connection. This can be accomplished in several ways including a purchased domain name, a free domain name service such as [NoIP.com](https://www.noip.com/) etc. We will not cover how to achieve this here, but we will provide examples of common Reverse Proxy configuration files. If you would like to contribute your working Reverse Proxy config please join us in the Discord channel to discuss.

!! **Warning**: Kavita only supports subdomain at this time and not sub-directory. e.g https://kavita.example.com is supported where https://example.com/kavita is not supported.
