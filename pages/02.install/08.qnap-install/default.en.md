## QNAP Install
While the Kavita team does not own any  QNAP devices, there does exist an image maintained by a third party. You can find it [here](https://www.forum-nas.fr/threads/kavita-net-apache80-0-5-1-1-a-fast-feature-rich-cross-platform-reading-server.16507/) although note that the image usually lags behind our stable releases by quite a bit.

Users have reported that our docker image works perfectly fine on QNAP, which will enable you to stay up to date and also partake in the nightly docker releases. If you are interested in helping us maintain an official image for QNAP, please reach out to us in discord.
