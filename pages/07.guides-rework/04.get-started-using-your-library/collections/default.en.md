### Collections

By selecting the Edit option in the Context Action Menu![Kavita%20Context%20Action%20Menu](Kavita%20Context%20Action%20Menu.png "Kavita%20Context%20Action%20Menu"), a Collections tag can be created and will be used to create a collection with that name. Other Books/Comics/Manga can have this Tag added to become part of the Collection which will be shown on the Kavita Homepage.

![kavita_Collections_Details](kavita_Collections_Details.webp "kavita_Collections_Details")
Collections will appear at the bottom of the Kavita homepage. 
![kavita_homepage_Collections](kavita_homepage_Collections.webp "kavita_homepage_Collections")

![kavita_Collections_page](kavita_Collections_page.webp "kavita_Collections_page")
