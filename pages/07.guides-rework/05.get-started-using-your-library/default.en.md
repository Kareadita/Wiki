## Series Details
Series detail is the main page where you can see a series and all the entities related to it. As you can see below, there are a number of controls. To start, the series cover image is displayed along with the title of the series. From the buttons you can [Continue Reading](#continue-reading), [Edit Series](#edit-series), Download the whole series, or add/edit your [rating and review](#rating-and-reviews).

Below this section is the metadata and collection tags. Collection tags can be clicked to view all items in that collection, while metadata tags can be clicked to open a filtered search query for said filter. For example, if you clicked Cover Artist "Cory Walker", then a search against anything that the user has access to that is tagged with Cover Artist of Cory Walker will be shown.

### Rating and Reviews

![Example](Example.PNG "Example")
Kavita allows for you to track your rating and provide a review for yourself all within Kavita. Currently Kavita has it's own, separate system, however Scrobbing and Syncing to external sources is planned.

To provide a rating, click the star icons. When you first provide a rating, a prompt will ask if you want to review. Adding a text based review is optional. If you clicked no and want to add or edit your rating or review, you can click the edit icon displayed next to the star rating.
