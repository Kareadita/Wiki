title: 'Reading Lists'

A reading list is an ordered list of chapters that can be of mixed media types. Admin's can promote reading lists so all users can see them, but not edit them. Otherwise, reading lists are per-user.

Users can read through in one go a reading list and the readers will transition between the different readers. For example you can have Manga -> Manga -> Book -> Manga and you can read that without closing the reader. The order can be manipulated via drag and drop or by using input boxes on right hand side to manually adjust the position. Position changes save automatically. Lastly, if you are using a reading list to track new chapters added to your server and want to quickly clear it out when you've gone through them, there is a "Remove Read" button which will remove any fully read chapters from the list.
